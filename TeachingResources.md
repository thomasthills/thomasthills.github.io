## Building a network from the students in your classroom

This starts by having the classroom develop an affiliation network by filling out a shared online google sheet.  You can send students the link, change the names in the first column to those of your students, and change the features or affiliations in the first row to things that your students are interested in.

You can run the RMarkdown file linked below in RStudio. It contains a link to a Google sheet you can use as an example.  The code in the file demonstrates all the content with your classroom network as the primary example.

The link to the code is [**here**](BNS_NetworkCode.Rmd)
