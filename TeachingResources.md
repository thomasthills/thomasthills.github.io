# Teaching Resources

Resources for this book currently include code for working through the first three chapters of the book, "A Brief Guide to Network Science," with a classroom. 

This starts by having the classroom develop an affiliation network by filling out a shared online google sheet.  You can send students the link, change the names in the first column to those of your students, and change the features or affiliations in the first row to things that your students are interested in.

You can then run the attached code in RStudio and demonstrate all the content with your classroom network as the primary example.

The link to the code is [**here**](BNS_NetworkCode.Rmd)
