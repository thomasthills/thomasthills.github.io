_Behavioural Network Science: Language, Mind, and Society_ provides a brief introduction to network science alongside an exploration of theory and problems in the behavioural sciences, including topics like language evolution, development, memory, creativity, conspiracy theories, aging, human conflict, and group problem solving. This book includes fully commented R code and data to reproduce all simulations and figures.
