This page provides resources for replicating figures and simulations in _Behavioral Network Science: Language, Mind, and Society_ (Cambridge University Press) by Thomas T. Hills.  

This includes the R code and data. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/thomasthills/BehavioralNetworkScience). You can download the zipped data from [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/thills/thills/sampledatafilesbns.zip)

*Part I* is a useful place to start for those unfamiliar with network science.
*Part II-IV* focus on specific methodologies and topics associated with language, mind, and society.
